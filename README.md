# ChaosVM Executor

A Python envirionment for Tencent ChaosVM.

## Usage

```python
from chaosvm import prepare
from urllib.parse import unquote

tdc = prepare(vmjs, "114.5.1.4")            # see docstring for more info
print( tdc.getInfo().__dict__ )             # a python dict
print( unquote(tdc.getData(None, True)) )   # a python str
```

To get `TDC_itoken`:

```python
# retrun the window object, instead of its TDC field
win = prepare(vmjs, "114.5.1.4", return_window=True)
tdc = win.TDC                               # the way to get TDC object
print( win.TDC_itoken )                     # 114514514:1919810810
```
